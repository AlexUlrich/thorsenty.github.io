Welcome everyone,

My name is Ty and this is my development blog. I'm building this site/blog using [Jekyll][jekyll], and hosting it on [GitHub Pages][gh-pages]. I'll be using this space to write about technology news, interesting challenges I come across in my professional work, little side projects I may be working on in my spare time, and the process of constructing this site.

If you have any comments or questions, don't hesitate to reach out via any of the methods listed on the [contact page][contact]. Similarly, if you like what you see and would like to collaborate on a project in the future, I'd love to hear from you.

I hope you enjoy reading.

Cheers,

Ty
